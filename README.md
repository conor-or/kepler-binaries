# Finding Planets in the Kepler EB Data

In this project we'll hunt for planets orbiting binary stars using the publicly available Kepler data. We've got the data for __50 eclipsing binary stars__. Some number of these binary stars are known to have planets: _it's up to you to find out which!_

Read the below to get started and follow any links to papers for more detail on certain parts.
